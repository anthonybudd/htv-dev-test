# HTV Technical Assessment

Build a **multi-tenant Request Hub** that demonstrates your ability to create production-ready SaaS applications with real-time features, clean architecture, and modern tooling.

## What You're Building

A mini version of HTV's Request Hub featuring:
- **Multi-tenant authentication** with company switching
- **Request submission** that creates Linear tasks  
- **Real-time status updates** via webhooks
- **Admin dashboard** for cross-tenant visibility
- **Clean, professional UI** using modern design patterns

## Core Requirements (Must Have)

### 1. Multi-Tenant Authentication
- Use Clerk for authentication with organization support
- Support switching between two test companies
- Proper data isolation per tenant
- Role-based access (user vs admin vs super-admin)

### 2. Request Management  
- Submit request form (title, category, description)
- Store in PostgreSQL with tenant isolation
- Automatically create Linear task on submission
- Display request list filtered by company

### 3. Real-Time Updates
- Implement webhook endpoint for Linear status changes
- Push updates to UI in real-time (Pusher/Ably recommended)
- Show status changes without page refresh
- Handle connection/reconnection gracefully

### 4. Admin Dashboard
- View requests across all tenants
- Filter by company
- Basic impersonation capability
- Request status management

### 5. Professional UI
- Use Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Loading states and error handling
- Clean, modern SaaS aesthetic
